This guide is a self-learning guide made to allow people to learn Python offline.
This guide is currently targeted at beginners with little to no experience in programming or Python.
I hope to be able to expand it further, making it a resource to help those who are already proficient even stronger.
I will only go over what is "built-in" to Python in this guide. This will include some libraries in Python's standard library.

The style Python is taught in this guide is "learn by doing".
What that means is, I'll introduce a topic, give examples, and then have you do a practice.
Try to do all the practices, they'll help with thinking skills necessary when creating new programs.
Also try not to skip ahead, as you may miss a few key points.

The practice will correlate with what I've taught in each lesson.
Please don't rename files, or move them.
Each practice will build on top of previous ones.
In the beginning, practices will have check programs or algorithms, either built in or seperate.
However, in later practices, you will have to judge on your own, This is to help build your own debugging skills, that are necessary in real life.


Disclaimers
Everything will be as accurate as possible to my knowledge.
However, that means that if my knowledge is lacking, this guide will be as well.
If you find anything wrong in this guide, please let me know by opening a bug report.
