This guide is a self-learning guide made to allow people to learn Python offline.
This guide is currently targeted at beginners in Python.
I hope to be able to expand it further, making it a resource to help those who are already proficient even stronger.
I will only go over what is builtin to Python in this guide. This includes some libraries in python's Standard library 

The style Python is taught here is "learn by doing".
What that means is, I'll introduce a topic, and then have you do a practice.
Try not to skip ahead, as you may miss a few key points

The practice will correlate with what I've taught in each lesson.
The difficulty of each practice may vary for each person.
Each practice will build on top of previous ones.
