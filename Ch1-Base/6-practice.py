# Given a number n, Output all terms up to and including the nth term of the Fibbonacci sequence.
# Assume 1, 1 are the starting two terms.
# ex. Input A: 6   Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
# Output as a list or seperated by newlines. ## Hint: the former is easier, at least for me.
# Be sure to regenerate the sequence each time.

# If you don't know what that is, The Fibonacci Sequence is [nth term] = [nth -1 term] + [nth -2 term]
# Thus [3rd term] = [2nd term] + [1st term]  ;  Thus 2 = 1 + 1
# Thus the third term is 2.
