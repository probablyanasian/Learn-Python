# Variables

# Variables are used to store data

#This is a variable
var = 1 # Type: int

#Their value is set with an '=' sign
var = 'this' #Type: str

#Their value can be changed after being set
var = 'that' #Type: str

#You can also delete them
del var
# The variable var doesn't exist here


## They can hold many different types of data

#Integers are numbers
var = 1 # Type: int

#Strings are letters, words, or symbols
var = "string" # Type: str

#Lists can contain a 'list' of things, seperated by commas
var = ['a','list','of','things'] # Type: list

#A dictionary is like a list, but data is stored in key:value pairs
var = {'key':'value'} # Type: dict

#Tuples are like lists, but they have to have the same amount items inside, after creation
var = ('a', 'tuple') # Type: tuple

#Booleans store a True or False
var = True #Type: boolean
