# Variables

# Variables are used to store data

# This is a variable
var = 1  # Type: int

# Their value is set with an '=' sign
var = 'this'  # Type: str

# Their value can be changed after being set
var = 'that'  # Type: str

# You can also delete them
del(var)
# The variable var doesn't exist here


# They can hold many different types of data

# Integers are numbers
var = 1  # Type: int

# Strings are letters, words, or symbols
var = "string"  # Type: str
var = 'string'  # Type: str

# Lists can contain a 'list' of things, seperated by commas
var = ['a', 'list', 'of', 'things']  # Type: list

# A dictionary is like a list, but data is stored in key:value pairs
var = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2':'value2'}  # Type: dict

# A set is also like a list, however it doesn't store order.
var = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'} # Type: set

# Tuples are like lists, but they're immutable, the values it holds can't change after being created
var = ('a', 'tuple')  # Type: tuple

# Booleans store either True or False
var = True  # Type: boolean
