This will deal with Python semantics, the meaning of some terms in Python.
This is just some descriptions/definitions, NOT a dictionary.

Keywords 
    Keywords are reserved words that serve a predefined purpose.

Built-in
    Built ins are functions that are in the module builtins.
    These functions can be accessed directly.

Scopes
    Scopes are seperated by indents between function definitions.
    They dictate which variables/functions can be accessed at a certain location.
    They are commonly represented as circles or squares, one encapsulating, surrounding, the other.

    Built-in Scope
        This scope only includes all builtins and can be accessed in any Python file.
    Global Scope
        This is the scope that is available everywhere in the same file.
    Enclosed Scope
        When two functions are nested, defined in another, the inner function is within the enclosed scope of the outer.
        This means that the inner function has access to variables in it's encapsulating function.
    Local Scope
        This is the innermost scope, it contains all variables and functions defined above it, in terms of scope.

Class
    A class is an object.
    It allows you to create multiple instances an object.

Inheritance
    A class can inherit functions of a different class when created.
    This is when a class does so.

Exceptions
    Errors that are raised when running erroneous Python code.
