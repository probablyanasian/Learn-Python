# Try taking in 2 numbers seperately, then compare the two.
# Don't worry about negative inputs for now, since we're comparing ascii/unicode values right now, not their 'int' values
# Print back whether the 2nd number is 'greater than', 'less than', or 'equal' to the first.
# eg. Input A: 11   Input B: 3    Returns: less than
