# Try taking in an input, which will be a string that's more than 3 letters long
# Print back out only the first [amount] letters. Then try the last [amount] letters.
# Don't worry about giving an input that's less than 3 letters, we'll fix it in lesson 4.

# Use input(), slice(), and print(). optional(list())
# Check by running 2-check.py
