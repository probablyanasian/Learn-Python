# Learn-Python
A streamlined way of learning Python 3.x by doing.

## Start learning
1. Install [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Whichever is the latest version of Python 3.
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you haven't already.
   - Or download as a zip, however updates will be harder to get.
1. Install an editor that you'd be comfortable using. Ex. VS Code, PyCharm
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://www.github.com/probablyanasian/Learn-Python`
1. Open up Ch1-Base/1-variables.py in your editor and you're ready to start learning!

### Updating
1. Run `git pull` to update to the current version.

   

##### Things to note

- When you do practices, run the program to see if you did everything right
- Some programs may not have a checking program inside, you'll have to judge if you did it correctly or not. (It shouldn't be too difficult)
- This is self-learning, only by being true to yourself will you learn

- There may be some initialization lines at the beginning to prevent errors

- You can help by sharing this, and in doing so, help people learn Python
